AvaIre Suggestions
==================

AvaIre Suggestion is a simple plugin that can be used by self-hosters of Ava to add a `!suggest` command that sends suggestions users make to a custom channel, all of this is done easily through the `config.yml` file that is generated by the plugin, you can seen an example of the file [here](https://github.com/avaire/suggestion-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/suggestion-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make ava recognize the plugin and to generate the config file.
3. Edit and customize the config file however you'd like.
4. Either use the `;reload` system command, or restart the bot to update the config.

And you're done!
